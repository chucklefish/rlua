default = ["builtin-lua"]
# Builds the correct version of Lua 5.3 inside the crate. If you want to link a
# specialized version of lua into your binary, you can disable this feature to
# do that, but care must be taken.  `rlua` expects the linked lua to define
# LUA_INTEGER as long long, and LUA_NUMBER as double, and may make other
# assumptions about how lua is built.
